Arm Motion Mimicking using OpenCV and Simulink

## Description

This project uses OpenCV and Simulink to mimic arm motion. The program opens a camera and captures the user's arm motion, which is then simulated in Simulink. The project is written in MATLAB and Python.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install MATLAB and Python. You also need to install the following libraries:

* OpenCV
* Matlabl Simulink

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory
3. Run the `script.init.m` file
4. Follow the instructions in the program to open the camera and start mimicking arm motion
